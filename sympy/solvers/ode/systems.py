    Convert a linear system of ODEs to matrix form

    Explanation
    ===========

    Express a system of linear ordinary differential equations as a single
    matrix differential equation [1]. For example the system $x' = x + y + 1$
    and $y' = x - y$ can be represented as

    .. math:: A_1 X' + A_0 X = b

    where $A_1$ and $A_0$ are $2 \times 2$ matrices and $b$, $X$ and $X'$ are
    $2 \times 1$ matrices with $X = [x, y]^T$.

    Higher-order systems are represented with additional matrices e.g. a
    second-order system would look like

    .. math:: A_2 X'' + A_1 X' + A_0 X = b

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import (Function, Symbol, Matrix, Eq)
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import linear_ode_to_matrix
    >>> t = Symbol('t')
    >>> x = Function('x')
    >>> y = Function('y')

    We can create a system of linear ODEs like

    >>> eqs = [
    ...     Eq(x(t).diff(t), x(t) + y(t) + 1),
    ...     Eq(y(t).diff(t), x(t) - y(t)),
    ... ]
    >>> funcs = [x(t), y(t)]
    >>> order = 1 # 1st order system

    Now ``linear_ode_to_matrix`` can represent this as a matrix
    differential equation.

    >>> (A1, A0), b = linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, order)
    >>> A1
    Matrix([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]])
    >>> A0
    Matrix([
    [-1, -1],
    [-1,  1]])
    >>> b
    Matrix([
    [1],
    [0]])

    The original equations can be recovered from these matrices:

    >>> eqs_mat = Matrix([eq.lhs - eq.rhs for eq in eqs])
    >>> X = Matrix(funcs)
    >>> A1 * X.diff(t) + A0 * X - b == eqs_mat
    True

    If the system of equations has a maximum order greater than the
    order of the system specified, a ODEOrderError exception is raised.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(x(t).diff(t, 2), x(t).diff(t) + x(t)), Eq(y(t).diff(t), y(t) + x(t))]
    >>> linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ODEOrderError: Cannot represent system in 1-order form

    If the system of equations is nonlinear, then ODENonlinearError is
    raised.

    >>> eqs = [Eq(x(t).diff(t), x(t) + y(t)), Eq(y(t).diff(t), y(t)**2 + x(t))]
    >>> linear_ode_to_matrix(eqs, funcs, t, 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ODENonlinearError: The system of ODEs is nonlinear.

    Parameters

    Returns

    the matrix representing the rhs of the matrix equation.

    Raises

def matrix_exp(A, t):
    r"""
    Matrix exponential $\exp(A*t)$ for the matrix ``A`` and scalar ``t``.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This functions returns the $\exp(A*t)$ by doing a simple
    matrix multiplication:

    .. math:: \exp(A*t) = P * expJ * P^{-1}

    where $expJ$ is $\exp(J*t)$. $J$ is the Jordan normal
    form of $A$ and $P$ is matrix such that:

    .. math:: A = P * J * P^{-1}

    The matrix exponential $\exp(A*t)$ appears in the solution of linear
    differential equations. For example if $x$ is a vector and $A$ is a matrix
    then the initial value problem

    .. math:: \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = A \times x(t),   x(0) = x0

    has the unique solution

    .. math:: x(t) = \exp(A t) x0

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, Matrix, pprint
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import matrix_exp
    >>> t = Symbol('t')

    We will consider a 2x2 matrix for comupting the exponential

    >>> A = Matrix([[2, -5], [2, -4]])
    >>> pprint(A)
    [2  -5]
    [     ]
    [2  -4]

    Now, exp(A*t) is given as follows:

    >>> pprint(matrix_exp(A, t))
    [   -t           -t                    -t              ]
    [3*e  *sin(t) + e  *cos(t)         -5*e  *sin(t)       ]
    [                                                      ]
    [         -t                     -t           -t       ]

    Explanation
    ===========

    Returns the Jordan form of the $\exp(A*t)$ along with the matrix $P$ such that:

    .. math::

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, Symbol

    >>> t = Symbol('t')

    We will consider a 2x2 defective matrix. This shows that our method
    works even for defective matrices.

    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 1], [0, 1]])

    It can be observed that this function gives us the Jordan normal form
    and the required invertible matrix P.

    >>> P, expJ = matrix_exp_jordan_form(A, t)

    Here, it is shown that P and expJ returned by this function is correct
